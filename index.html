									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/3.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Reflection: Through our visit to UTM Digital and the Virtual talk, we profoundly realized the importance of big data in our lives. This experience not only allowed us to see the application of big data across various fields but also demonstrated its multifunctionality and omnipresence. Big data is more than just a pile of numbers; it is a dynamically evolving entity that influences decision-making, guides trends, and deeply permeates our daily lives. Its real-time impact on our lives, from consumer behavior to social interactions, is evident everywhere. This visit made it clearer that to stand firm in this data-driven era, it is essential to understand and harness the power of big data.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Assignment 4</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/4.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Reflection: After attending the industrial lecture by Credence, I gained new insights into a comprehensive understanding of system development. The lecture made me profoundly aware that becoming a successful system developer requires not only excellent programming skills but also strong soft skills, such as teamwork, effective communication, and time management. Seeing my teammates' reflections, I became even more aware of how to become an outstanding individual. Regarding how to effectively integrate data in business analysis and data engineering, as well as how to transform this data into practical business insights, I gained valuable insights. I realized the importance of keeping my knowledge up-to-date in the ever-changing field of technology and am determined to combine theoretical knowledge with practical experience to meet the demands of the industry. By planning my learning path and career goals, I believe I can succeed in this challenging and opportunistic field.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">PC Assemble (Lab)</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/5.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Reflection: The experience in the PC Assemble (Lab) allowed me to physically assemble a computer, and it also enlightened me about the complexity and precision of computer hardware. I realized that the absence of even a single PC component can prevent the system from functioning. These components made me clearly understand how they work together to ensure the efficient operation of a computer. In summary, this hands-on experience deepened my understanding of the importance of theoretical knowledge and practical application.</p>

									<p>I believe that future industrial lectures should focus more on practical operations and case studies. This approach will make our lectures more interesting and prevent students from concentrating solely on theoretical knowledge, thereby enhancing the practicality of the learning experience.</p>
